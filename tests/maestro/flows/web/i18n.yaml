# Maestro E2E Test: i18n Setup
# Task 8.3a - Client Testing Agent
# 
# This test validates that i18n is properly implemented:
# - Translations are loaded
# - No hardcoded strings visible
# - Translation hook works correctly

url: "http://localhost:3000"
---
# Launch the web app

# Wait for app to load
# Wait (handled by assertions)

# Verify translations are loaded (check for translated text)
# Navigate to home screen first
- runFlow: auth_anonymous.yaml

- assertVisible:
    text: "הלומד"

# Verify no hardcoded strings (this is more of a code review check)
# Maestro can't easily detect hardcoded strings, so this is a placeholder
# The validation script handles the actual checking
