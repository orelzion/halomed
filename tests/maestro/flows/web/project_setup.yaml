# Maestro E2E Test: Web App Project Setup Validation
# Task 8.1a - Client Testing Agent
# 
# This test validates that the Next.js web app is properly set up:
# - App can be launched and loads
# - Basic structure is in place
# - TypeScript compilation works
# - Tailwind CSS is configured

url: "http://localhost:3000"
---
# Launch the web app

# Wait for app to load (Maestro waits automatically on assertions)

# Verify app loads (check for basic HTML structure)
- assertVisible:
    text: "הלומד"

# Verify page is not blank (check for body element)
- assertVisible:
    id: "__next"

# Verify no console errors (basic health check)
# Note: Maestro may not catch all console errors, but this is a basic validation
